Appendix:
Since it is not written in the assignment whether we should only have server.py and client.py,
we separated some backend code (process.py) from the server.py since we wanted to have more
modularity and readability.

We made sure to do version control and regular updates using Github.
We communicated through whatsapp and also made sure to meet face to face to debug the code
together and test different use cases together. We also reviewed each other's work and gave
suggestions where needed and helped to fix each other's bugs.
